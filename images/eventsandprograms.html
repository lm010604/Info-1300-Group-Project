                    <p>WICC is dedicated towards fostering an inclusive space for individuals of all identities to feel empowered to speak on issues in the CIS community, both on- and off-campus. We hold monthly discussions encompassing topics such as diversity in tech, the definition of success, and more. It is our goal to have a greater number of voices heard and to have a greater breadth of women and allies voicing their opinions at the table.</p>
                    <h3>Last Community Discussions:</h3>
                    <h4>September 2023</h4>
                    <p>This was our WICC Away event where kicked off the Fall semester. We introduced WICC and our mission to attendees, hosted an allyship workshop, had a painting session, then wrapped up our night with a WICC Q&A Panel!</p>
                    <h4>Febuary 2022</h4>
                    <p>This was our G-Body #1 where kicked off the Spring semester. We met WICC faculty advisors and reflected on our Fall semester to get ready for the new semester. We learned about setting and completing goals through intention framing and journaling.</p>
                    <h4>March 2022</h4>
                    <p>This was our G-Body #2 where we had discussions about taking care of ourselves and having empathy for others. At the end, we created a WICC wall of notes and got to know each other.</p>
