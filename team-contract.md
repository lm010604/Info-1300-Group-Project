# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    To create a professional, aesthetic, responsive, interactive, accessible website for our client.
    To have fun!

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    Everyone does their part.
    Work in a timely manner.
    Be respectful.
    Actively listening and no interrrupting.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    iMessage group chat as main source of communication.
    1-2 times meetings per week in-person or virtually.
    Text when someone commits.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    Text our client and schedule virtual meetings with our clients.
    2-3 team member can interview our client each meeting.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Point of Contact - directly communiates with client and schedules meetings as needed.
    Submitter - submits milestones, check final merging conflicts, and edit overall.
    Content collector - collects all the content from client and/or create more content.
    Rescaler - rescales images and ensure content is formatted correctly.
    Note-taker - takes notes during client and team meetings

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    Text in the group chat to ensure work is being done in a timely manner.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    Set up in-person meetings, standup to update progress, take a vote.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    If we have a big issue, we can re-visit this contract and make edits. We can all reread the contract every few weeks to ensure we are following it.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    Encouraging text messages and ice cream/coffee/boba after successful milesone.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
