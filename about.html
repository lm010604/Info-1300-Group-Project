            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>
                WICC&rsquo;s Community team regularly engages with students interested in tech through our mentorship program, allyship workshops, and socials. Our goal is to help foster meaningful relationships and make anyone feel included and welcome in CIS at Cornell. In the past we&rsquo;ve hosted the WICC Away retreat and CIS Formal, held community discussions on speaking up for yourself, and hosted multiple allyship events in collaboration with other organizations at Cornell.

            <h2>Outreach</h2>
            <p>
                WICC extends our influence through outreach aimed at inspiring young students to consider and pursue fields in tech. We run a weekly Girls Who Code program for high school and middle students in the Ithaca area, intended to teach our students the basic principles of computing and encouraging the possibilities beyond these basics. In addition, we host a series of workshops with the Tompkins Public Library three times a semester, aimed at problem solving, critical thinking, and robotics to give younger students a taste of the power of technology. Other workshops in collaboration with organizations like Splash and Hack For Impact are also hosted throughout each semester as a blend of both programs to target a more casual setting for exploring both areas.
